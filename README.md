# DeployMaster 3000

Welcome to the most over-engineered "Hello World" app you've ever seen! This project is a testament to the art of making simple things complicated, all in the name of DevOps.

## Features

- Express.js server that says hello
- MySQL database connection (that we don't actually use... yet)
- Redis cache (because why not?)
- Docker setup for easy* development
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (it's not much, but it's honest work)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `docker-compose up`
3. Wait
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
5. Marvel at the complexity of saying "Hello"

## TODO

- Figure out why we added Redis
- Actually use the MySQL database
- Implement real tests
- Optimize the Dockerfile
- Add more routes
